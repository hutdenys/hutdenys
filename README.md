ðŸš€ DevOps Intern | Cloud & Automation Enthusiast

I'm a DevOps intern passionate about building reliable, automated, and observable infrastructure. Iâ€™ve worked with tools like Docker, Jenkins (CI/CD), Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible, and Iâ€™m confident in setting up and managing systems using Linux and networking fundamentals.

ðŸ”§ I have hands-on experience with:

Monitoring & Observability: Splunk, OpenTelemetry

Web & App Stack: Nginx, SonarQube

Databases: MariaDB, PostgreSQL

Infrastructure as Code: Currently learning AWS and Terraform to deepen my cloud and automation skills

I use GitHub to share personal projects, experiment with new tools, and document my learning journey in the DevOps world.

ðŸ“š Always learning. Always automating.
